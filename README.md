Reanalysis of ["The Effectiveness Of Government Masking Mandates On COVID-19 County-Level Case Incidence Across The United States, 2020"](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01072) by Huang et al. in Health Affairs.

The matches csv was generated using Adobe Acrobat.

All covid case data was downloaded from [USA Facts](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/). In these csvs, I modified some of the county names to align with the conventions Huang et al. used in their supplement. In particular Parish became County in Louisiana, and all of the cities in Virginia were renamed counties.
